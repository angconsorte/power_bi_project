This dashboard solves the problem of scattered job data by providing a centralized platform to explore job market trends, compensation, and job counts.

## Key Features:
- **Data Transformation (ETL) with Power Query**: Data was cleaned, shaped, and prepared for analysis, handling missing values, changing data types, and creating new calculated columns.
- **Implicit Measures**: Formulated measures to derive key insights such as median salaries and job counts.
- **Visualization**: 
  - **Column, Bar, Line, and Area Charts**: Used to compare job counts and track trends over time.
  - **Map Charts**: Showcased global distribution of data jobs.
  - **KPI Indicators & Tables**: Displayed key metrics and allowed users to view detailed, sortable job data.
  - **Cards**: Presented essential metrics like job count and median salary.
